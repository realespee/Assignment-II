CALCULATING NETWORK SECURITY METRICS

1.Introduction

Metrics are tools designed to facilitate decision making and improve performance and accontability through collection ,analysis and reporting of relevant performance related data .security metrics can be considered as a standard (or system )used for quantitatively measuring an organisation's security posture .security metrics are essential to comprehensive network security and CSA management ,without good metrics analysts can not answer many security related questions .The calculation of network security metrics is a complex problem which involves understanding the state and configuration of network connections,device and protocols

1.1.Background to the problem

This research analyses the problem of calculating network security and purpose of a framework which can calculate security metrics for a typical small network comprising of numerous devices,operating systems and hosts.This project will involve the configulation of virtual networks for testing the framework.CVSS or other metric scores may be used to the calculation of metric.This dissertation involves pratical work which has a number of machines on the network and applying a range of scanning,probing and vulnerability testing mechanisms on the network.
